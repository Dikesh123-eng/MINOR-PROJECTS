MINOR PROJECTS
                                                           1.Banking System

For a minor C++ project related to a banking system, you can focus on creating a simple application that allows users to perform basic banking operations like opening an account, depositing money, withdrawing funds, checking balance, and potentially viewing transaction history, all within a text-based interface, utilizing data structures to store account information effectively. 
Key features to include in a basic banking system project:
Account creation:
User input for account details like name, account number, initial deposit.
Account number generation (can be a simple counter or a more complex algorithm).
Data storage using arrays, structs, or simple file handling to store account information.
Login functionality:
User input for account number and password.
Basic validation checks for correct credentials.
Transactions:
Deposit function: prompt user for deposit amount and update balance.
Withdrawal function: check if sufficient funds are available before updating balance.
Transaction history: store details of each transaction (date, type, amount).
Account information display:
Function to display current account balance.
Option to view recent transactions. 

                               2.Function OverLoading
                               
n C++, function overloading is the ability to define multiple functions with the same name but different parameters. 
How it works
The compiler chooses which function to use based on the number and types of arguments passed in. 
The function call decides which overloaded function to run. 
Function overloading is a feature of object-oriented programming. 
Benefits Function overloading makes code more readable and reusable, It helps to improve runtime, It saves memory space, and It makes maintaining and debugging code easier. 
Example
You can overload a function named "print" to display different types, like int, double, and char*. 
You can overload a function named "addPodium" to add different types of numbers. 
Function overloading vs. function overriding
Function overloading is different from function overriding, which is when a derived class redefines a function of the base class.
