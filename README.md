                                                           1.Banking System

For a minor C++ project related to a banking system, you can focus on creating a simple application that allows users to perform basic banking operations like opening an account, depositing money, withdrawing funds, checking balance, and potentially viewing transaction history, all within a text-based interface, utilizing data structures to store account information effectively. 
Key features to include in a basic banking system project:
Account creation:
User input for account details like name, account number, initial deposit.
Account number generation (can be a simple counter or a more complex algorithm).
Data storage using arrays, structs, or simple file handling to store account information.
Login functionality:
User input for account number and password.
Basic validation checks for correct credentials.
Transactions:
Deposit function: prompt user for deposit amount and update balance.
Withdrawal function: check if sufficient funds are available before updating balance.
Transaction history: store details of each transaction (date, type, amount).
Account information display:
Function to display current account balance.
Option to view recent transactions. 

                                                2.Constructor Overloading

  Constructor overloading in C++ is a feature that allows a class to have multiple constructors with different parameter lists. Each constructor can have a different number or type of parameters, enabling objects of the class to be initialized in various ways depending on the provided arguments.
